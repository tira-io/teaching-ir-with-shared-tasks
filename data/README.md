# Data

This directory organizes the data used to create the corpora, mainly for pooling.

## How-To

For each new corpus respectively IR course, create a new directory and add the topics.xml file there, i.e.:

- <new-course>/topics.xml

Then, run `./pooling.py <new-course>` to create all additional data.
