# Relevance Judgments

Given a topic and a collection of documents, the task is to retrieve and rank documents by relevance to the topic.

Please follow the instructions below to judge the relevance of retrieved documents.

## 1. Read Topic

Each topic is represented by its title, narrative, and description.

- **Title:** \
  Short title of the information need, that could be used as a search query.
- **Description:** \
  Description/definition of the information need (e.g., the situation and/or task)
- **Narrative:** \
  Instructions on what to judge as <kbd>relevant</kbd> and <kbd>not relevant</kbd>. Often, the narrative might not cover all the nuances.

Please carefully read the topic's title, narrative, and description.

## 2. Read Document

Now, please read the document carefully, while keeping the topic in mind.

## 3. Judge Relevance

Finally, judge the document's relevance for the topic, according to the topic's narrative.

- <kbd>relevant</kbd>: \
  The document is relevant to the topic.
- <kbd>not relevant</kbd>: \
  The document is _not_ relevant to the topic.

Note that the narrative might not always cover all nuances of relevance. \
In general, a document is relevant if it satisfies the information need formulated in the topic.
