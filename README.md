# IR_Pad

The IR_Pad is intended as collection supplementary material for the exercises in the information retrieval courses of the University of Leipzig and Jena.
Therefore, we provide a set of tutorials that show a single concept using a tiny example in Jupyter notebooks, aiming to showcase a single concept in 15 minutes.
