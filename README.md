# 👩‍🔬 ir-pad

Resources for combining teaching and research in information retrieval coursework.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/webis-de/ir-pad?quickstart=1)

The ir-pad is intended as a collection of supplementary materials for exercises in IR courses that let students experience the full research cycle in their course. We provide:

- A [dashboard](#dashboard) to support brainstorming
  - Explore datasets, approaches, and evaluation techniques
  - Easy to use [online](https://tira-io.github.io/teaching-ir-with-shared-tasks/)
  - Links to in-depth resources
- A set of [tutorials](#tutorials) covering IR concepts
  - Showcases a single concept using small example data
  - Takes about 15 minutes per tutorial
  - Implemented as Jupyter notebooks in [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/webis-de/ir-pad?quickstart=1)
- An integration with TIREx to support [reproducible experiments](#reproducible-experiments)
  - Reuse strong baselines from [TIREx](https://tira.io/tirex)
  - Code submissions for reproducible experiments
  - Leaderboards encourage competition between students
- A [dataset browser](#dataset-browser) of the finished courses
  - Explore topics, documents, relevance judgments, and submitted runs
  - Archived on Zenodo and GitHub Pages
  - Deep links for referencing in research papers

## Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
  - [Dashboard](#dashboard)
  - [Tutorials](#tutorials)
  - [Reproducible experiments](#reproducible-experiments)
  - [Dataset browser](#dataset-browser)
- [Testimonials](#testimonials)

## Installation

The easiest way to start with the tutorials is to open this repository in GitHub Codespaces: \
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/webis-de/ir-pad?quickstart=1) \
This will install all necessary software. Just wait until the editor window has fully loaded (i.e., no progress bars visible; may take a while). \
The other resources (i.e., [dashboard](#dashboard), [reproducible experiments](#reproducible-experiments), and [dataset browser](#dataset-browser)) are just web apps that you can run in your web browser.

## Usage

In the following, you will learn how to use each of the four main components of the ir-pad:
the [dashboard](#dashboard), the [tutorials](#tutorials), [reproducible experiments](#reproducible-experiments), and the [dataset browser](#dataset-browser). The sections roughly follow the order as you would use the components in your course (either as student or teacher).

Our accompanying [research paper](#citation) includes a case study and describes our experiences of using the ir-pad in the IR courses of two universities over two semesters.

## Similar resources

We took inspiration from some great tutorials and resources out there. Of course, the ir-pad should not replace but complement them:

- [The PyTerrier Tutorial](https://github.com/terrier-org/ecir2021tutorial)

## Contributing

With the plethora of new retrieval approaches emerging every year, it is hard for us alone to keep the ir-lab up-to-date and to add new tutorials. We would be extremely happy, if you (as an IR teacher) could take some time to improve an existing notebook or to propose a new one!

Contributing to the ir-pad is as easy as using it: Just [open this repository in GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/webis-de/ir-pad?quickstart=1) (or alternatively, clone it and open the repo in a [Dev container](https://containers.dev/) with your [favorite IDE](https://containers.dev/supporting)).
